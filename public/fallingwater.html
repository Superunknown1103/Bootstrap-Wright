        <div>Fallingwater, the house designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright
           for Edgar Kaufmann in southwestern Pennsylvania, hangs over a waterfall using
            the architectural device known as the cantilever. Wright described his architectural
             style as "organic"--in harmony with nature, and though Fallingwater reveals
              vocabulary drawn from the International style in certain aspects, this country 
              house exhibits so many features typical of Wright's natural style, the house very
               much engaged with its surroundings.</div>

          <div>Responding to the financial crisis of 1929 and ensuing Great Depression that gripped
             the United States and the rest of the world, Wright began working on affordable housing
             , which developed into the Usonian house. Wright’s Usonians were a simplified approach
              to residential construction that reflected both economic realities and changing social
               trends. In the Usonian houses, Wright was offering a simplified, but beautiful
                environment for living that Americans could both afford and enjoy.

            <div>Wright’s work from 1899 to 1910  belongs to what became known as the
               “Prairie Style.” With the “Prairie house”— a long, low, open plan structure that eschewed
                the typical high, straight-sided box in order to emphasize the horizontal line of the prairie 
                and domesticity— Wright established the first truly American architecture. In a Prairie house,
                 “the essential nature of the box could be eliminated,” Wright explained. Interior walls were
                  minimized to emphasize openness and community.

            After Wright’s death, most of his archives were stored at the Frank Lloyd
             Wright Foundation in Taliesin (in Wisconsin), and Taliesin West
              (in Arizona.) These collections included more than 23,000 
              architectural drawings, about 40 large-scale architectural models,
               some 44,000 photographs, 600 manuscripts and more than 300,000 
               pieces of office and personal correspondence. Most of these models 
               were constructed for MoMA's retrospective of Wright in 1940.
               In 2012, in order to guarantee a high level of conservation and
                access as well as to transfer the considerable financial burden
                of maintaining the archive, the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation
                 partnered with the Museum of Modern Art and the Avery Architectural
                  and Fine Arts Library to move the archive's content to New York.
                   Wright's furniture and art collection remains with The Foundation,
                    which will also have a role in monitoring the archive.
                     These three parties established an advisory group to oversee
                      exhibitions, symposiums, events and publications.
